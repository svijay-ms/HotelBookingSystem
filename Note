As requested I have done the Hotel Booking System

In the program class file I have created two methods to demonstrate with and without thread safe call to make sure the BookingManager implementation support both scenarios.
Also these two methods can test separately or together. 

Then I have done the couple of unit tests to make sure the logic does support for all possible scenarios.

As mentioned in the requirements, I didn't use any persistence object for storing booking status. Just used Dictionary in BookManager class itself.

I'm happy to brief if there any clarification or conflict in the implementation. Thanks.
